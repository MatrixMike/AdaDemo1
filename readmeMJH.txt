when reviving a Raspberry Pi I discovered a baby steps Ada program. I must have been using a CL interface to compile. The executable was present and so I dug around to find other ways to compile and discovered GNAT.
I created a repo on github and then proceeded to 'pull' it down to the RPi. I sometimes have trouble with new repos but this worked well. 

The RPi image I used was configured to start on command line mode. To start the GUI - startx.
This revealed in the 'other' run options the GNAT programming studio.
