Ada : gcc-13.2.0 downloaded : http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-13.2.0/

configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 3.1.0+ and MPC 0.8.0+.
Try the --with-gmp, --with-mpfr and/or --with-mpc options to specify
their locations.  Source code for these libraries can be found at
their respective hosting sites as well as at
https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/.  See also
http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html for additional info.  If
you obtained GMP, MPFR and/or MPC from a vendor distribution package,
make sure that you have installed both the libraries and the header
files.  They may be located in separate packages.

sudo apt install gnat-10  # version 10.5.0-1ubuntu1~22.04, or

run   -> gnatmake <xxx.adb>
